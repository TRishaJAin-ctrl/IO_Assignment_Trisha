IMPLEMENTING QUEUES USING STACKS:-

(We require two stacks to imitate the functioning of a queue)


TO ENQUEUE:

1. Pop elements from stack 1 and push into stack 2 until stack 1 is empty.

2. Push the element to be enqueued into stack 1.

3. Pop elements from stack 2 and push them back to stack 1 until stack 2 is empty.

TO DEQUEUE:

1. First, we need to check whether stack 1 is empty. 
   If so, an error message should be displayed 'Underflow'. 
   Because there's no element to throw away.
   
2. Pop an element from stack 1 and return it.
